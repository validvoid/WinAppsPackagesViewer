# WinAppsPackagesViewer

A tiny WPF tool for browsing packages of installed modern apps & dependencies.

Remember to add **C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\References\Windows.Foundation.UniversalApiContract\2.0.0.0\Windows.Foundation.UniversalApiContract.winmd** as a reference.

**DO NOT MESS UP OTHER APPS WITH THIS TOOL. JUST USE IT TO CHECK WHETHER YOUR APP WORKS FINE WITH ITS LOCAL STORAGE.**
